            The purpose of the laboratory component of the course is several-fold. It reinforces the material
            you have learned in class and it gives you a chance to apply your knowledge. You will learn some
            important experimental techniques that are necessary for you to become an effective chemist.
            The most important component of completing a laboratory successfully is your pre-lab
            preparation. You will make fewer mistakes if you have read and understood the lab write-up. In
            many cases you will need to figure out how to make up the necessary solutions for the lab before
            coming to the lab; there isn't enough time for these calculations during the lab. A half-hour of
            time spent before the lab may save hours on Monday (or Tuesday) afternoon. Short quizzes at
            the start of some of the labs will help you to remember to prepare. You may use your lab
            notebook for these quizzes, but not the lab write-up. You must change lab partners each week.
            The first week of lab covers error analysis and least-mean-squares curve fitting, which requires
            the use of the computer. This assignment will help to refresh your spreadsheet skills. These
            techniques will be used repeatedly throughout the year.

          <h3 class="label">Communication lab</h3>

          <p>
            The Communication Lab is a discipline-specific peer-coaching program for MIT’s School
            of Engineering that helps students and postdocs with their scientific writing, speaking, and visual design.
            By hiring and training students and postdocs as Communication Fellows, the Communication Lab offers individual
            coaching, targeted workshops, and a spectrum of initiatives to support engineers as they learn key transferable communication
            skills that will help them achieve their career goals.While we are not able to support students from other institutions
            with individual coaching appointments, we encourage the use of our online CommKit, which is open and available to all.
            Communication and information flow or transfer throughout the healthcare setting are very complicated. It is the responsibility
            of laboratory management to ensure that the information flow is bidirectional. The laboratory should not simply send out information,
            memos, policies, and procedures but should have a mechanism for receiving information from its clients. Management should have a
            communication strategy—a plan that is used whenever the laboratory has information that it wants to disseminate.

            Welcome to Computer Science Lab, home of the finest computer programming curriculum for high school and home school students and curious
            adults of all ages. This free Windows CD-ROM includes all the tools, manuals, and example programs that you need to learn computer programming.
            This unique computer curriculum offers 3 different environments of graduated complexity: a programmable RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) calculator,
            an Intel 8051 microprocessor that is programmed using assembly language, and finally the high-level C and C++ languages.
            Each of these 3 languages comes complete with an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides an editor, compiler, and debugger. You get
            fully explained solutions to fun programming projects such as a scrolling electronic signboard, a robotic mouse in a maze, an audio peak detector
            using an LED bar graph, and the Breakout video game. All of these example programs have been designed to be highly visual, audible, and fun.
            In addition to the introduction to assembly language programming and the introduction to C and C++, this curriculum offers an introduction
            to Windows programming and graphical user interfaces. You can find screen shots and further description of each of these programs on the Catalog page.
            How did I choose to teach assembly, C, and C++? These 3 languages are used in 89 % of the embedded devices (i.e., laser printers, camcorders, MP3 players, etc.)
            in your home and car. In contrast, Java is employed in only 3 % of embedded devices due to its poor performance.
